        - üß± "Risk knowledge is an essential component of effective disaster
          risk management. The available impact data from previous disasters
          serve as invaluable tools for disaster preparedness and
          decisionmaking support. The project, titled "Hazard Modeling, Impact
          Estimation, Climate Storylines for Drought and Flood Disasters in
          Eastern Africa" (short form ‚ÄúE4DRR‚Äù), is a two-year project
          funded by the Complex Risk Analytics Fund (CRAF‚Äôd) and
          implemented by ICPAC in collaboration with NORCAP." üß±
